Hi All,

Battle Tanks is a game inspired by the classical game Battlezone made by 
Atari in 1982 which could be played in casino's everywhere in the eighties.
The game is a real classic. I have always been amazed how few information
the human mind needs to find something stimulating and enjoyable which can 
perfectly be seen in this game which uses only green lines on a black 
background to make a thrilling war game with tanks.

If you have never seen and played the game then try it out for yourself.
I have implemented the basic working with tanks but you can of course also
implement the fast tanks and rockets later on.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move all the maps 
(except My Project) to the bin/debug directory when you want to run the code.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
